Description: Implementation of a principal component analysis in the 
    two-dimensional torus via density ridge estimation. The main function,
    ridge_pca(), obtains the relevant density ridge for bivariate sine
    von Mises and bivariate wrapped Cauchy distribution models and provides
    the associated scores and variance decomposition. Auxiliary functions
    for evaluating, fitting, and sampling these models are also provided. The
    package provides replicability to García-Portugués and Prieto-Tirado
    (2022) <arXiv:2212.XXXXX>.
